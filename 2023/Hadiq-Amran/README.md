##Introduction!
Hello Wagtail Community!
I'm Amran Hadiq, a passionate Pythonist, JavaScript enthusiast, and open-source evangelist from East Africa. I'm excited to join the Wagtail project through Outreachy.
Why Wagtail and Outreachy:
I believe in the power of open source to transform lives. Wagtail's commitment to empowering content creators aligns perfectly with my goals. I see Outreachy as an opportunity to contribute my skills, collaborate with a vibrant community, and make a meaningful impact.

#What I Bring:
With my expertise in Python and JavaScript, I'm eager to dive in, learn, and collaborate. I'm not just here to code; I'm here to foster inclusivity and support within the community.
I look forward to contributing to Wagtail's success and growing together.
Warm regards,
Amran Hadiq
